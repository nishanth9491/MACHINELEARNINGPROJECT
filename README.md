Fake News Detection Project
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on fake news detection. The project utilizes three different algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to develop an effective model for distinguishing between real and fake news articles.

Project Structure
data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the models. Ensure that the dataset is appropriately formatted and labeled.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks are provided for each algorithm, detailing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. Feel free to explore and run these notebooks to understand the workings of each algorithm.

scripts/: Python scripts for training and testing the models. You can run these scripts from the command line to perform various tasks, such as training a new model or evaluating an existing one.

models/: Save the trained models in this directory for future use and reference.

requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.


Usage
Training:
Train the models using the provided scripts or notebooks. Adjust hyperparameters and features based on your dataset.

Testing:
Evaluate the models on new data using the testing scripts. The results will provide insights into the performance of each algorithm.

Model Deployment:
Once satisfied with a model, deploy it for use in your applications to identify fake news articles.

Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this project by opening issues, proposing enhancements, or submitting pull requests. Your feedback and collaboration are highly valued.
